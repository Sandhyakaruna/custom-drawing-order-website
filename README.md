# Custom Drawing Order Website

This project is a web-based application built using **Java Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to order custom drawings by submitting their details via a form. The backend handles data storage, and the frontend provides an interactive user experience with a clean, responsive design.
